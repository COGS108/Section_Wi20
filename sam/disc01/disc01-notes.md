## License plate demo

Based on [this lecture from Data 8][lec]. Start at 19:26 for the demo.

- Meant to demonstrate how data that appears simple can be interesting to analyze.
- Comes from Oakland PD's automated license plate readers.
- Police cars automatically capture license plates as they drive around town.
- So we can look at specific license plates to see what we get.
  - Jean Quan is the former mayor of Oakland. We got her license plate by
    looking at the news and finding her car in a picture taken by a reporter.
  - Can also look at the fire chief of Oakland.
  - Then, we look at license plates that were spotted many times. We can pick
    out where people sleep, work, and play.

## Taking attendance

http://bit.ly/at-wi20

- To take attendance, have students count off. The number they count for
  themselves is the number they need to enter in the attendance form.
- You should also make clear that you have noted down the total number of
  students for your section.
